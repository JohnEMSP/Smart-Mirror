This app is intended for use with Windows IOT and has specific support for GPIO buttons like those found on RPi. Since it's UWP it can also be run on Windows x86. Unfortunately the app doesn't make great use of layouts so other screen sizes don't really work well.

This app has 3 pages. The main page shows the date, digital and analog cock, weather forecasts, and 12hr weather timeline. The 2nd page shows 12 hr weather timeline and 12day timeline. The 3rd page shows a calendar. Some server work was done to interface with a mobile App. To switch pages you can setup a GPIO button.
